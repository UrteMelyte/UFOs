# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
This project utilized JavaScript to create an interactive webpage of UFO sightings, including a filtered table by time, city, state, country, etc.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Utilize the filters to the left of the page to refine the data by one or more of the following metrics:
- Date (1/1/2010-12/31/2010)
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape (light, triangle, sphere etc)

The search is case sensitive, so use all lower case letters even for cities/states. Enter the criteria and either hit enter or click outside of the field. The example above shows results for California that had a "light" shape designation.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
- Drawback: The filters are case sensitive, so states or cities cannot be capitalized or they'll return no results
- Development: A drop down list for shapes, as not everyone would be familiar with the options
- Development: A reset filter button
